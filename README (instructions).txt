This calculator can calculate multiple functions that are built into program. This program is subject to change as more functions get added and edited.


In order to use the calculator correctly please use the file "start.cmd" to opperate the calculator. One in the calculator
you can use some of the functions that are included. 
Some are going to be replaced but as of now this is the working version.



Instructions on how to start the calculator:

1. Make sure a version of Java is installed on your computer. If not use this link (https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

2. Download these files and make sure there in the same place (like in the same file so they work normally)

3. Use the "start.cmd" file to run the calculator in a viewable interface

4. Function descriptions (follow the prompts for each function to use the calculator correctly)

	Function 1: (converts the ammount of research you entered into an ammount of Golden Eagles)
	Function 2: (if your looking for what pack to buy for lions, for exact ammounts needed use fucntion 6)
	Function 3: (gives you the exact price in Golden Eagles, that your said ammount of days will cost you. Use function 7 to convert the Golden Eagles into dollars)
	Function 4: (give you an estimate for how long it will take to grind a said amount of research)

Known bugs:




Function 8
  
- The following has been having issues with large ammounts of golden eagle pricing. Me and my friend are still trying to sort
 out why this issue is occuring. 
  May be a simple fix but will post an update ASAP when we fix it. Regardless it works with
 numbers lower than 10,000
