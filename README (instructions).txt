# Official-War-Thunder-Calculator

This calculator can calculate multiple functions that are built into program. This program is subject to change as more functions get added and edited.


In order to use the calculator correctly please use the file "start.cmd" to opperate the calculator. One in the calculator
you can use some of the functions that are included. 
Some are going to be replaced but as of now this is the working version.



Instructions on how to opperate:

1. Make sure a version of Java is installed on your computer. If not use this link (https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

2. Download these files and make sure there in the same place (like in the same file so they work normally)

3. Use the "start.cmd" file to run the calculator in a viewable interface

4. Use it to the extent of what you need it for

5. Leave suggestions on what functions you want to see next



Known bugs:


Function 1
  
- Fixing the max aircraft you can put into the function as we speak and will be re-uploaded once it has been fixed



Function 4
  
- Havent made it print the options so dont uses as were working on finishing the last function that is more simplified and
 better for the users



Function 8
  
- The following has been having issues with large ammounts of golden eagle pricing. Me and my friend are still trying to sort
 out why this issue is occuring. 
  May be a simple fix but will post an update ASAP when we fix it. Regardless it works with
 numbers lower than 10,000
